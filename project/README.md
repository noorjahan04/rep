# Rick and Morty Wiki Application

## Project Description

The *Rick and Morty Wiki Application* is a web-based character encyclopedia built using the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). Users can browse characters in a paginated grid, view detailed information about each character in a separate page, and enjoy a live-updating clock footer. This project demonstrates asynchronous data fetching, responsive design, and client-side routing for detailed views.

### Key Features

*Character Gallery*: Displays six characters per page in a 3×2 grid layout.
*Pagination*: “Next” and “Previous” buttons to navigate through all available characters.
*Character Card*:
  - Image
  - Name
  - Species
  - Status (Alive, Dead, Unknown)
  - Clickable link that opens a detail view in a new tab.
*Character Details Page*:
  - Full-size image
  - Name, Status, Species, Type, Gender
  - Origin location & Current location
  - Episode appearances (count)
*Live-Updating Footer Clock*: Shows current time in format HH:MM:SS Day Date (e.g., “14:30:45 Friday March 17, 2025”).
*Optional Enhancements*:
  - Dark/Light theme toggle
  - “Random Character” button

## Challenges Faced

### 1. *Handling Asynchronous API Calls*

Working with the fetch() API to retrieve character data and dynamically populate the page was initially tricky. It required properly chaining .then() methods and handling loading/error states manually without any framework like React.

### 2. *Pagination Logic*

Implementing "Next" and "Previous" functionality required maintaining the current page state and updating the API query accordingly. I had to ensure that pagination didn’t go below page 1 or exceed the total number of pages returned from the API.

### 3. *Responsive Design*

Designing a 3×2 grid layout that remains responsive on various devices was a challenge. I used CSS Grid with media queries to ensure the layout adjusts cleanly on smaller screens (e.g., 2×3 or 1×6 layouts on phones).

### 4. *Opening Details in New Tab*

Instead of using frameworks with built-in routing, I had to manually handle navigation by passing the character ID through the URL and reading it on the detail page with URLSearchParams.

### 5. *Live Footer Clock*

Creating a live-updating clock in vanilla JavaScript required using setInterval() and formatting the time/date manually with built-in Date methods. Ensuring it works on both pages consistently required writing reusable time logic.
